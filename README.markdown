# Build a Computer from First Principles - Nand2Tetris

Personal self-study following the "[Build a Computer from First Principles](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/)" ("[Nand2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/)") coursework, with supplementary educational explanations.

## Explanations

In addition to the [projects](projects) coursework, this repository contains an "[Explanations](explanations)" folder. This folder contains a decription of my understanding of the implementation for each chip. As I improve my understanding of each chip (i.e., logic gate), I will ammend the explanation file for that chip to describe any further insights I have about its implementation, such as possible optimizations and why they work, how to reduce the number of chip components (chip-parts) required, and so on.
