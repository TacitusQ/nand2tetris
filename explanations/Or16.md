# `OR` logic gate

The Hardware Description Language (HDL) description of the `OR` functionality begins like this:

```
CHIP Or16 {
    IN a[16], b[16];
    OUT out[16];

    PARTS:
    // Put your code here:
}
```

Much as with the earlier multi-bit implementations, the key concept here is to continue to build on your prior work. This is just another multi-bit logic gate that borrows its logic for each individual bit from [its single-bit variant](Or.md).
